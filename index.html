        <div class="sec-content-div flexible">
          <p>
            We are a group of people with decades of experience in 
            selling coffees. The coffee plant requires a tropical or subtropical climate to grow. 
            Generally speaking, the coffee needs to be grown within 1,000 miles of the equator.
            Elevation doesnâ€™t matter much as it can be grown at sea level, all the way up to 7,000 feet.
            The coffee is often depulped using a machine turned by a hand crank. It separates the bean from the cherry.
             Other coffee farmers use an electric machine to depulp their cherries.
             As you can see, growing great coffee is equal parts science and art. At Carta Coffee, we grow, harvest, process, and roast our own beans. 
             This enables us to enact strict quality control standards which allow for our beans to produce some of the greatest tasting coffee you can buy.
